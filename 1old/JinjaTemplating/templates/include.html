{##################Including with context CONCEPT##############################}
<h2>Including with Context</h2>
<p>By default, included templates have access to the variables of the parent template's context but, <br>
'with context' and 'without context' can be used to control context passing.</p>

<h3>Explicitly Controlling Context Passing</h3>
    <p><span>with context:</span> pass the current context to the included template</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>&lbrace;&percnt; include "greeting.html" with context &percnt;&rbrace;</span></li>
            <li>though for include, 'with context' is redundant as it is the default, but it will allow you to explicitly control context passing</li>
            <li>often used for clarity or when the default behavior might be overridden in specific scenarios</li>
        </ul>
    <p><span>with block:</span> passes specific variables to an included template within a new, isolated context</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the variables defined within the with block are available to the included template but do not affect the context of the parent template</li>
            <li>setting the variables using a with block will prevent the current context of the parent template variables values from being passed</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Handling Missing Templates</h2>
    <p>If you want to include a template only if it exists, you can use the ignore missing keyword</p>

        <li> will prevent an error if optional_section.html is not found</li>
